# Screenshots for the Anki AI Extension

To finalize the preparation of the extension for publication in the Raycast store, you need to save the shared images as screenshots in the following format:

1. Save the first image (flashcard preview) as `screenshot-1.png` in this folder
2. Save the second image (flashcard generation) as `screenshot-2.png` in this folder

These images will be used in the Raycast store to showcase the extension's functionality.
