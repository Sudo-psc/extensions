# Screenshots for the Anki AI Extension

To finalize the preparation of the extension for publication in the Raycast store, you need to save the shared images as screenshots in the following format:

1. Save the first image (flashcard preview) as `screenshot-1.png` in this folder
2. Save the second image (flashcard generation) as `screenshot-2.png` in this folder

These images will be used in the Raycast store to showcase the extension's functionality.

## Screenshot Requirements

According to Raycast's guidelines:

- Screenshots should be 2000 x 1250 pixels (landscape)
- Use a background with good contrast that makes the app and extension clearly visible
- Be consistent and use the same background across all screenshots
- Do not share sensitive data in your screenshots
- Avoid using screenshots in different themes (light and dark) unless demonstrating a theme-specific feature

## How to Take Screenshots

1. Set up Window Capture in Raycast's Advanced Preferences (Hotkey e.g.: `⌘⇧⌥+M`)
2. Ensure your extension is opened in development mode
3. Press the hotkey and tick "Save to Metadata"

You can use [Raycast Wallpapers](https://www.raycast.com/wallpapers) to make your background look professional.
